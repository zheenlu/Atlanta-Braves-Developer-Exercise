# Baseball Data Visualization Project

This is a web-based data visualization app providing insights into baseball data using three visualizations: **Exit Speed and Launch Angle by Batter**, **Play Outcome Distribution**, and **Hit Distance vs Launch Angle**. Users can toggle between light and dark themes and navigate through paginated charts.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Bar and pie charts showing relationships between various baseball data points.
- **Pagination**: View 20 batters at a time for easier data navigation.

## Visualizations
1. **Exit Speed and Launch Angle by Batter**: Bar chart showing the exit speed and launch angle for each batter, with pagination.
2. **Play Outcome Distribution**: Pie chart displaying the distribution of different play outcomes (e.g., Out, HomeRun, etc.).
3. **Hit Distance vs Launch Angle**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between hit distance and launch angle.
